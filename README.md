#### [20+ Unemployment Rates](https://github.com/uuumama/PORTFOLIO/tree/main/Unemployment%20Rates)
Code: [nojob.ipynb](https://github.com/uuumama/PORTFOLIO/blob/main/Unemployment%20Rates/nojob.ipynb)

Dataset Description: The dataset consists of the breakdown of US unemployment rates based on gender and age from 1948 to 2023. (kaggle dataset sources FRED)

Objective: As a recent 22-year-old graduate navigating the dynamic job market, I explored the unemployment landscape intending to better understand the challenges faced by individuals around my age group, specifically recent graduates. Considering factors such as gender and age ranges, I aim to uncover insights that contribute to a more comprehensive perspective on the contemporary job market in comparison to previous generations. This exploration is motivated by genuine curiosity, fostering a connection between personal observations and broader socioeconomic trends.
