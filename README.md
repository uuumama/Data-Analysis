### Projects

#### [20+ Unemployment Rates](https://github.com/uuumama/PORTFOLIO/tree/main/Unemployment%20Rates)
Code: [nojob.ipynb](https://github.com/uuumama/PORTFOLIO/blob/main/Unemployment%20Rates/nojob.ipynb)

Dataset Description: The dataset consists of the breakdown of US unemployment rates based on gender and age from 1948 to 2023. (Kaggle dataset sources FRED)

Objective: As a recent 22-year-old graduate navigating the dynamic job market, I explored the unemployment landscape to better understand whether individuals around my age group, specifically recent graduates, faced unemployment. Considering factors such as gender and age ranges, I aim to uncover insights that contribute to a more comprehensive perspective on the contemporary job market compared to previous generations. This exploration is motivated by genuine curiosity, fostering a connection between personal observations and broader socioeconomic trends.

#### [Gun Violence](https://github.com/uuumama/PORTFOLIO/tree/main/Gun%20Violence)
Code and Visualizations: [gv.ipynb](https://github.com/uuumama/PORTFOLIO/blob/main/Gun%20Violence/gv.ipynb)

Dataset Description: The dataset entails mass shooting violence from January 1, 2023, to December 15, 2023. Sourced from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA).

Objective: Highlight the instances of gun violence as a result of mass shootings within the U.S. "Mass Shootings: The Role of the Media in Promoting Generalized Imitation" states that as of 2015, a mass shooting results in the death of at least four people every 12.5 days; however, these common incidents are not reported in the news cycle as frequently.
