# WELCOME

#### Hello! In my portfolio, I explore complex datasets, aiming to uncover hidden insights as an aspiring data scientist. My focus is on cultivating a deep understanding of diverse analytical techniques to unravel nuanced patterns and dynamics. 



## Projects

### [20+ Unemployment Rates](https://github.com/uuumama/PORTFOLIO/tree/main/Unemployment%20Rates)
Code: [nojob.ipynb](https://github.com/uuumama/PORTFOLIO/blob/main/Unemployment%20Rates/nojob.ipynb)

Dataset Description: The dataset consists of the breakdown of US unemployment rates based on gender and age from 1948 to 2023. (Kaggle dataset sources FRED)

Objective: As a recent 22-year-old graduate navigating the dynamic job market, I explored the unemployment landscape to better understand whether individuals around my age group, specifically recent graduates, faced unemployment. Considering factors such as gender and age ranges, I aim to uncover insights that contribute to a more comprehensive perspective on the contemporary job market compared to previous generations. This exploration is motivated by genuine curiosity, fostering a connection between personal observations and broader socioeconomic trends.

### [Mass Shootings in 2023](https://github.com/uuumama/PORTFOLIO/tree/main/Mass%20Shootings%202023)
Code and Visualizations: [gv.ipynb](https://github.com/uuumama/PORTFOLIO/blob/main/Mass%20Shootings%202023/gv.ipynb)

Dataset Description: The dataset entails mass shooting violence from January 1, 2023, to December 15, 2023. Sourced from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA).

Objective: Highlight instances of gun violence resulting from mass shootings in the U.S. According to "Mass Shootings: The Role of the Media in Promoting Generalized Imitation," as of 2015, a mass shooting occurred approximately every 12.5 days, resulting in the death of at least four people. Despite the frequency of these incidents, they are not reported in the news as often as they happen. I have presented data on the casualties associated with mass shootings and created a predictive model illustrating the number of victims injured for a suspect to be arrested.
